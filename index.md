We are a collective of tech founders, executives, venture investors, and software engineers who have created the first-ever Open Source Endowment. Our mission is to provide open source maintainers with a new non-profit source of funding that is:

1. **🌱 Sustainable**: Ensures long-term, predictable cash flow, independent of economic and political volatility
2. **🔗 Systemic**: Prioritizes critical yet underfunded OSS, rather than large/popular ones or specific supply chains
3. **🚀 Scalable**: Operates as an efficient next-gen charity designed for scale, not a like a typical non-profit foundation

## Our principles
The Open Source Endowment is inspired by diverse ideas, including the [parallels between OSS and the best research universities](kvinogradov.com/oss-universities) and a [data-driven approach to open-source donations](https://kvinogradov.com/algo-sponsors/). While we will reveal full details later, these core principles guide our project:

* **🤖 Digital-first**: Operate like a lean tech startup, maximizing automation and minimizing unnecessary overhead
* **🌍 Global Outlook**: Support the entire global open-source ecosystem, not just specific countries or regions
* **🔎 Radical Transparency**: Publish key internal data whenever possible, balancing openness with privacy
* **👥 People-First**: Champion inclusive, community-led governance, focusing on passionate individuals over corporations
* **🧠 SMART Goals**: Use an endowment model to achieve measurable, long-term objectives requiring regular funding
* **🕸️ Decentralized**: Maintain a highly diversified funding base, ensuring that every donation matters.
* **⚖️ Neutrality**: Remain independent from political or corporate influence, ensuring unbiased, mission-driven funding
